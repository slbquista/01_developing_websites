Add a comments system, so this would require user accounts to login in order to comment.

Additionally there should be one or more admin accounts that have additional content available to them on the website.

The gallery should read from a database table of links to externally hosted images.

Perhaps for desktop there should be an individual page for each comic page, instead of a gallery.
